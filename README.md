# Bug Hunt Challenge: Random Number GUI App

Welcome to the Bug Hunt Challenge! 🐞

## Objective

This app is meant to:
- Display a "Run/Stop" button.
- When "Run" is clicked, display random numbers every 0.5 seconds.
- When "Stop" is clicked, stop displaying numbers.

But... it's buggy! 🔧

## Your Challenge

Find **three bugs** hidden in this GUI app.

### How to Start
A. Running the unit test
1. Run test_app.py to run the unit test. This covers the core logic of the application, including:
   - Toggling between Run and Stop states
   - Whether the label updates with numbers when running
   - Whether updates stop when toggled off
Note that not all bugs can be found in unit test.

B. Run the app to test manually
1. Run the Python script `buggy_random_gui.py`.
2. Test the app behavior carefully:
   - What happens when you click "Run" and "Stop" repeatedly?
   - Are there any inconsistencies with the label or button?
   - Does anything unexpected happen?

Happy bug hunting!
